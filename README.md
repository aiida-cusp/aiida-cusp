# aiida-cusp -- a Custodian based VASP Plugin for AiiDA

Custodian plugin for VASP enabling automated error correction for
[AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net) managed VASP calculations

## Highlights

- Automated error corrections for VASP calculations on the calculation's
  runtime level rather than on the workflow level.
- Compatability with Pymatgen and easy access to Pymatgen's rich set of
  implemented tools for pre- and postprocessing of VASP calculations directly
  from the implemented datatypes
