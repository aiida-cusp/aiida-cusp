Calculator Classes
******************

This section contains the documentation for the available calculator classes offered by the plugin and available to run a VASP calculation.

.. note::

   Although this may change in the future, currently only a single calculation class is implemented by the plugin.
   However, the class is entirely controlled by the input files you provide (similar to running VASP manually).
   Thus, although providing a single calculator only, the plugin is capable of running **all** kind of VASP calculations.
   This, of course, also includes NEB calculations (See the calculator class documentation for detailed information)
