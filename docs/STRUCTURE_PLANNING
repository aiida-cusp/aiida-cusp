AiiDA Cusp

VASP Plugin for AiiDA using the Custodian Framework to run VASP calculations
featuring automated error corrections on the runtime level. As this plugin was
designed with fast and easy simulation pre- and postprocessing in mind, all
implemented input and output datatypes are tightly connected to the pymatgen
framework maintaining direct access and compatability with the rich set
of analysis tools

- Installation
	- Discuss the installation of the plugin via conda and pip
	-	Also discuss the installation from source directly using the
		lates version from the github repository
- Getting the Plugin ready
	Working AiiDA installation is assumed in the following
	- Setup of Codes
		Discuss the different behavior of the Plugin requiring two separate
		codes (i.e. VASP and Custodian). Mention the special properties of
		Custodian (python-script, no stand-alone executable) which makes it
		neccessary for the custodian executable to be installed on the target
		Computer.
	- Populating the Database with Potentials
		Discuss how to populate using the command line interface
	- Example
		Add very short example for setting up an easy and fast calculation
		so that user can directly start and get a feeling on how the plugin
		works.
